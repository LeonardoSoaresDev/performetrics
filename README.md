A simple performance data generator for Java applications

---

## Project overview

Most Java developers use the functions `System.currentTimeMillis()` or `System.currentTimeNanos()` inside their code to measure the elapsed time to perform some key operations. This is not a problem if you want to benchmark an application running in a dedicated system. However, the result is strongly affected by other activities in the system, such as background processes and I/O (e.g. disk and network activities). 

As from Java 1.5, it is possible to get additional metrics that may help you benchmark a task with some most accurate units, such as CPU time and user time.

This project provides useful methods for monitoring the performance of Java code in the unit type of your choice:

- **Wall clock time:** the elapsed time experienced by a user waiting for a task to complete (not necessarily a bad metric if you are interested in measuring a real user experience)

- **CPU time:** the total time spent using a CPU for the current thread

- **User time:** the total CPU time that the current thread has executed in user mode (i.e., the time spent running current thread's own code)

- **System time:** the time spent running OS code on behalf of your application (such as for I/O)
